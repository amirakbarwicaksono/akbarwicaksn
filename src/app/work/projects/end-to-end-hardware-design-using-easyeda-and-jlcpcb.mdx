## Overview

This project showcases a full end-to-end workflow for designing and manufacturing custom electronics using EasyEDA and JLCPCB. The goal was to build a fast, reliable, and repeatable pipeline that transforms a hardware concept into a professionally manufactured PCB with minimal friction. By integrating schematic design, PCB routing, BOM validation, and automated fabrication options, this workflow drastically cuts down development time—making rapid prototyping more accessible and efficient.

## Key Features

- **Unified Design Environment**  
  EasyEDA integrates schematic capture, PCB layout, and component libraries in a single workspace. This eliminates context switching and speeds up iteration cycles.

- **Automatic Electrical Rule Checking (ERC/DRC)**  
  Built-in validation helps identify routing mistakes, missing nets, incorrect connections, or footprint mismatches before the board goes to fabrication.

- **One-Click Fabrication Sync**  
  With the “JLCPCB Fabrication” button, Gerber files, drill files, pick-and-place data, and BOM are transferred directly from EasyEDA to JLCPCB without exporting manually.

- **Component Sourcing + SMT Assembly**  
  JLCPCB supports automated SMT assembly, pulling components directly from LCSC’s component library. This ensures accurate part placement and reduces human error during assembly.

- **Rapid Prototyping & Affordable Production**  
  JLCPCB offers quick turnaround times (as fast as 48 hours) with very low-cost PCB fabrication—making it ideal for R&D, hobby projects, and industrial prototypes.

## Technologies Used

- **EasyEDA Pro** for schematic design, PCB routing, footprint creation, and DRC validation.  
- **JLCPCB SMT Assembly** for fabrication, solder paste application, and automated component placement.  
- **LCSC Component Library** for seamless integration of parts with verified footprints.  
- **Gerber, Drill & Pick-and-Place Files** generated through EasyEDA’s unified export system.  

## Challenges and Learnings

One major challenge was ensuring that schematic symbols and footprints were accurate before manufacturing. To address this, I implemented a validation step that cross-checked all components against LCSC’s updated library. Another challenge was optimizing track widths, copper pours, and grounding to reduce noise—especially for mixed-signal and RF designs. Adjusting stack-up, clearance, and via size based on JLCPCB’s manufacturing capabilities played a crucial role in ensuring reliability.

## Outcome

The EasyEDA + JLCPCB workflow now allows me to go from concept to hardware in under a week. The boards manufactured through JLCPCB demonstrated high build quality, precise soldering, and consistent electrical performance. This process has become my standard pipeline for PCB development, greatly improving efficiency while reducing prototype costs.
