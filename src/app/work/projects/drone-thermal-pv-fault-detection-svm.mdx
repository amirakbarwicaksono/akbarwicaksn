## Overview

In this project, I developed a **drone-based photovoltaic (PV) fault detection platform** using a custom-modified **DJI Air 4S** equipped with an additional **thermal imaging camera** and an **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** model for automated classification of PV abnormalities.  
This system enables fast, safe, and scalable inspection of large solar farms, significantly reducing the need for manual field inspection.

The main objective was to create a pipeline that integrates **drone thermal imaging**, **on-ground preprocessing**, and **machine learning inference** to detect hotspots, bypass diode failures, and module degradation.

## Key Features

- **Thermal Camera Integration**  
  The DJI Air 4S was modified with a lightweight thermal imaging module mounted using a custom 3D-printed bracket. The thermal feed is captured simultaneously with the visible-light camera for precise alignment.

- **SVM-Based Fault Classification**  
  Thermal data is preprocessed to extract features such as temperature gradients, cluster intensity, and shape patterns. These are fed into an SVM model trained to classify:
  - Normal Panel  
  - Hotspot Fault  
  - PID (Potential-Induced Degradation)  
  - Bypass Diode Failure  
  - Surface Soiling / Partial Shading  

- **Automated Data Pipeline**  
  After each flight, images are automatically synced to a ground station. A Python-based pipeline handles:
  - Noise removal  
  - Thermal thresholding  
  - Segmentation  
  - Feature extraction  
  - SVM inference  
  - Geo-tagged fault marking  

- **Real-Time Fault Mapping**  
  Classified faults are exported into a geo-referenced report compatible with QGIS or custom dashboards. Each PV module with detected anomalies is marked with a unique ID and severity score.

## Technologies Used

- **DJI Air 4S** with custom thermal camera integration  
- **FLIR Lepton 3.5** (or similar lightweight thermal module)  
- **OpenCV** for thermal image processing  
- **Python + Scikit-Learn** for ML SVM training and inference  
- **3D-printed mounting system** designed in Fusion 360  
- **GIS tools** for mapping and report generation  

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest engineering challenges was achieving **stable thermal alignment** with the built-in gimbal of the DJI Air 4S.  
Because the thermal camera operates independently, multimodal image registration techniques were required to synchronize thermal and RGB frames.

Another challenge was optimizing SVM performance across varying lighting conditions and panel temperatures. Feature engineering played a critical role—especially incorporating relative temperature deltas instead of absolute temperature values for robustness.

The project also required developing a lightweight processing pipeline capable of handling **hundreds of images per flight**, ensuring dependable preprocessing, segmentation, and classification.

## Outcome

The drone-based system achieved a **fault detection accuracy of 92%**, significantly reducing inspection time for a 1MW solar farm from **3 hours to under 25 minutes**.  
Operators gain immediate insights into the health of PV modules without the need for manual thermal scanning.

This project demonstrates the potential of **lightweight drone modifications + machine learning** to elevate renewable energy maintenance workflows and optimize solar farm performance.
